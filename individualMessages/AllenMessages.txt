Allen Burias: Darin has let me know that they do not want to implement MFA, so that pretty much kills it unless we find out some way to use a different user pool :disappointed:
Allen Burias: I've put out an announcement regarding the MFA stuff. Did anyone need any help with their parts in the meantime? Wanna confirm first if we can keep the feature or not before continuing working on it.
Allen Burias: Was there anything important you wanted to discuss today? We can bring it up if there is

Allen Burias: Because those are very easy to bypass with bots now
Allen Burias: I was hoping he wouldnt say he prefers the really old kind of captcha with warbled text
Allen Burias: Ah I see, that should be easy to change
Allen Burias: Interesting, what did he say about captcha specifically?
Allen Burias: My assumption was work done from the first major report up til now
Allen Burias: I may need something similar in order to verify tokens for captcha
Allen Burias: Ayushmaan Tomar do you have a link to the lambda function you created for user logins? curious to see how you were able to implement it
Allen Burias: Ayush sent a link to canva here earlier
Allen Burias: Same, sorry for the delay
Allen Burias: Ill look into it, thanks
Allen Burias: Its kinda funny, the first results that pop up when you google "slider captchas" are tutorials that tell you how to bypass them with JS scripts
Allen Burias: Im aware of the type
Allen Burias: Thanks pratul
