Pratul Singh Raghava: Oh yeah for this error just go `npm install i --force`
Pratul Singh Raghava: Did somebody call tech support?:saluting_face:
Pratul Singh Raghava: I've created a new UserPool for us to experiment around with security stuff. Here are the new UserPoolID and ClientID :  1. *UserPoolID* : _ap-southeast-2_wWjdafdNy_ 2. *ClientID* : _m25b27nvhnujsjnso51ldqto7_ You can change these in : _nextjs-frontend-ui/src/aws/cognito/UserPool.ts_

Pratul Singh Raghava: Ah I see
Pratul Singh Raghava: Here's the link to the Figma designs for the Surveys page : <https://www.figma.com/file/rSJ2K8E09pb7nUAF1Tdjpz/Untitled?type=design&amp;node-id=0%3A1&amp;mode=design&amp;t=DcovvxMZgd5rDsSZ-1>
Pratul Singh Raghava: In that case, it doesn't make sense to have XP roles for Week 12 and Week 13
Pratul Singh Raghava: I just realised that the project development will only go on till Week 11 since the Final Report is due on the monday of Week 12
Pratul Singh Raghava: I expected it to be, but it was just yet another version of the website that we haven't seen so far
Pratul Singh Raghava: Surprisingly not
Pratul Singh Raghava: So no help
Pratul Singh Raghava: He showed me the Vercel page he had access to but it has no git repository linked to it and no environment variables in it as well
Pratul Singh Raghava: I'm meeting with Eddie again right now, if anybody wants to join : <https://uni-sydney.zoom.us/j/82773840176>
Pratul Singh Raghava: This is the meeting link : <https://us05web.zoom.us/j/82649592569?pwd=2ijREXi1OkypH6AZhcfw1S4TnyiPFb.1>
Pratul Singh Raghava: William Walker Are you working with the `stg-surveys` table on DynamoDB or `Surveys`?
Pratul Singh Raghava: Hmmm seems complicated, why don't you show it to me before or after the client meeting if you're free
Pratul Singh Raghava: What's your requirement exactly? What do you want to use?
Pratul Singh Raghava: The environment variables are supposed to be added to the vercel platform so that the code can use it when being hosted, but since we're running this locally rather than on Vercel, it's a bit different

Client asked us to refer to the figma designs supplied with the codebase as well 3. _Moderation Demo_ :      a. Client impressed with the prototype     b. Client inquired about the model used to implement it     c. No further comments on it by the Client 4. _Documentation_ :      a. Client would highly appreciate if we could document our work     b. Basically, make a document outlining everything we have changed with the code     c. Also, document changes made to and learnings about AWS
Pratul Singh Raghava: William Walker Just a reminder, you will have to start the meeting yourself before everybody else can join

Pratul Singh Raghava: Our client meeting for today will be at 2:15 instead of 2:00 as per the client's request
Pratul Singh Raghava: Is there a particular reason why we are putting pictures in-text, instead of linking them to the appendix?
Pratul Singh Raghava: Sure thing, I'm on it!
Pratul Singh Raghava: He gave the example of a supposed method that AliBaba uses which is just like a slider, but he just said look into more options
Pratul Singh Raghava: So overall, he wasn't very clear about what he wants but its definitely not the current implementation
Pratul Singh Raghava: I think he said he wasn't keen on the old text captcha because at times he couldn't understand what it was
Pratul Singh Raghava: I've submitted the formatted report and presentation
Pratul Singh Raghava: I'm just finishing off the formatting of the report
Pratul Singh Raghava: The report and presentation are good to go
Pratul Singh Raghava: It's all good, everything's done
Pratul Singh Raghava: What does "External APIs might not work" pertain to?
Pratul Singh Raghava: Sure

Pratul Singh Raghava: Yeah we need to package the code in a deployable version and ask Eddie how he wants it
Pratul Singh Raghava: Could you elaborate on what exactly you mean? Like transferring the repository from us to future developers?
Pratul Singh Raghava: Let's ask Eddie first and then we can send him a calendar invitation later
