Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Let's ask Eddie tomorrow if he's okay doing it next Tuesday
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Of course, go ahead XD
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Oh yeah, I forgot about that
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): He was happy to do it at 4PM last time, but we will have to let him know that the meeting will go on for at least an hour

Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): I have been researching and analysing the code shared by the other group wherein they have run the code locally
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): My initial assessment is that its not really of any help to us
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): The main feature they were unable to simulate locally was Cognito, which is something we are working with heavily for two of our user stories
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): My opinion is that we are better off working with what we have right now and just developing the new user stories that Eddie gave us
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Namely, documentation & research on proposals, i.e. how to make them better

Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Did somebody call tech support?:saluting_face:
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Oh yeah for this error just go `npm install i --force`
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): One thing I've realised is that it's better to do this report stuff as we go along, instead of rushing it at the end
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Especially for the individual reports


2023-09-06 00:00:00 week: 5
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Yep its because our Pro plan ended

Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): I think it'll only make sense after we talk to Eddie
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): This is great for us! We can choose whatever we want with no worry of what the other groups are choosing
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Eddie said he wants us working on stuff with priority 0

Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Let's see once we get access to the asana board
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): For the meeting with Eddie, let's try for Wednesday afternoon, so that we can have a good idea of what's to be done, before our presentation
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): I won't be able to make it on Wednesday due to work, so it's totally up to you guys
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Any ideas on what period the Gantt chart should cover (W2-W13?) and exactly what all needs to be shown on the chart?
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Important message by Eddie on the mega group:bangbang:
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Nope we have to send him all our emails for it
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): I think there's more on the actual board than on the asana screenshot
Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): We could request an extension on the scope till Thursday, given our special circumstances

Pratul Singh Raghava (n/a): Unfortunately, I have to run after this, I'm already late for something:grimacing:
