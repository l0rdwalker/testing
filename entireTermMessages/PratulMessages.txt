Pratul Singh Raghava: On it:saluting_face:
Pratul Singh Raghava: Should we just fill in Alexis' part for her since she's sick?
Pratul Singh Raghava: Sure
Pratul Singh Raghava: What does "External APIs might not work" pertain to?
Pratul Singh Raghava: It's all good, everything's done
Pratul Singh Raghava: The report and presentation are good to go
Pratul Singh Raghava: I'm just finishing off the formatting of the report
Pratul Singh Raghava: I've submitted the formatted report and presentation
Pratul Singh Raghava: I have been researching and analysing the code shared by the other group wherein they have run the code locally
Pratul Singh Raghava: My initial assessment is that its not really of any help to us
Pratul Singh Raghava: The main feature they were unable to simulate locally was Cognito, which is something we are working with heavily for two of our user stories
Pratul Singh Raghava: My opinion is that we are better off working with what we have right now and just developing the new user stories that Eddie gave us
Pratul Singh Raghava: Namely, documentation & research on proposals, i.e. how to make them better

Pratul Singh Raghava: Ah I see


2023-09-12 00:00:00 week: 6
Pratul Singh Raghava: I've created a new UserPool for us to experiment around with security stuff. Here are the new UserPoolID and ClientID :  1. *UserPoolID* : _ap-southeast-2_wWjdafdNy_ 2. *ClientID* : _m25b27nvhnujsjnso51ldqto7_ You can change these in : _nextjs-frontend-ui/src/aws/cognito/UserPool.ts_
Pratul Singh Raghava: Did somebody call tech support?:saluting_face:
Pratul Singh Raghava: Oh yeah for this error just go `npm install i --force`


2023-09-05 00:00:00 week: 5
Pratul Singh Raghava: Yep its because our Pro plan ended


2023-08-29 00:00:00 week: 4
Pratul Singh Raghava: Yep tomorrow for me is all about helping you guys get the code running
Pratul Singh Raghava: So sorry, I wrote the wrong UserPoolID and ClientID but I've fixed it now to the correct ones

Pratul Singh Raghava: OMG I THINK IT WORKED
Pratul Singh Raghava: My account is showing up on AWS as well
Pratul Singh Raghava: yep Eddie gave me the login credentials to the wrong account, so I wasted a lot of time setting up things from scratch
Pratul Singh Raghava: Eventually I realised I should check the other accounts for existing settings and voila I found the golden account which runs everything
Pratul Singh Raghava: I think so yeah
Pratul Singh Raghava: But this is just the front-end code, I'll have a crack at the posts-api, survey-api and user-management-api as well
Pratul Singh Raghava: I'll have a peek right now and report tomorrow morning
