After checking with the teaching team, we cannot grant formal extension for the presentation slides. You can develop your slides based on your current understanding for the project description and the materials provided by the client. Personally, I believe you possess the ability to propose your own solutions. For example, your group can present your plans for how to implement the entire project independently. You can also choose to propose a plan for project division and integration. It is not a stringent requirement that your development process should align with your presented plan at this stage, updates can be incorporated subsequently. 3.  Given that we regard this an as special case, you are allowed to submit an updated presentation slides following your client meeting. And you can use the revised slides for in-tutorial presentation.
